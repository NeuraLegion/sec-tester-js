# @secbox/core

The core package can be used to obtain a config including credentials from different sources, and provide a simplified abstraction to handle events and commands.

## Setup

```bash
npm i -s @secbox/core
```

## Usage

### Configuration

First, you need to generate a new instance of `Configuration`.

```ts
import { Configuration } from '@secbox/core';

const config = new Configuration({
  cluster: 'app.neuralegion.com',
  credentials: {
    token: 'your API key'
  }
});
```

After that, you can resolve the configuration using the IoC container.

```ts
const config = config.container.resolve(Configuration);
```

#### Options

Configuration can be customized using the following options:

```ts
export interface ConfigurationOptions {
  cluster: string;
  credentials?: Credentials;
  credentialProviders?: CredentialProvider[];
}
```

The default configuration is as follows:

```js
{
  credentialProviders: [new EnvCredentialProvider()];
}
```

#### cluster

- type: `string`

Set the application name (domain name), that is used to establish connection with. By default, the option is equal to `app.neuralegion.com`.

```ts
import { Configuration } from '@secbox/core';

const config = new Configuration({
  cluster: 'app.neuralegion.com'
});
```

#### credentials

- type: `Credentials`

Set credentials to access the application.

```ts
import { Configuration } from '@secbox/core';

const config = new Configuration({
  credentials: {
    token: 'your API key'
  }
});
```

#### credentialProviders

- type: `CredentialProvider[]`

Allows you to provide credentials and load it in runtime. The configuration will invoke one provider at a time and only continue to the next if no credentials have been located. For example, if the process finds values defined via the `BRIGHT_TOKEN` environment variables, the file at `.secboxrc` will not be read.

#### EnvCredentialProvider

Use this provider to read credentials from the following environment variable: `BRIGHT_TOKEN`

If the `BRIGHT_TOKEN` environment variable is not set or contains a falsy value, it will return undefined.

```ts
import { Configuration, EnvCredentialProvider } from '@secbox/core';

const credentialsProvider = new EnvCredentialProvider();
const config = new Configuration({
  credentialProviders: [credentialsProvider]
});
```

### Command

`abstract class` which one should extend your command class.

```ts
export class Test<T, R> extend Command<T, R> {
  // ...
}
```

The Command can be executed in a way that is more approach you or convenient from the client's perspective.

```ts
await new Command<T, R>(/*parameters*/).execute(dispatcher);
await dispatcher.execute(new Command<T, R>(/*parameters*/));
```

Command can be execute synchroniouse, to do it you should set `expectReply` to `true`.

|           Option           |   Type    | required/optional | Description                                                           |
| :------------------------: | :-------: | :---------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   **_command.payload_**    | dynamick  |    _required_     | Data that will be provided by EventBus                                |
| **_command.expectReply_**  | _boolean_ |    _optional_     | Indicates whether to wait for a response. By default `true`.          |
|     **_command.ttl_**      | _number_  |    _optional_     | Time what we should wait response. By default `10000`.                |
|     **_command.type_**     | _string_  |    _optional_     | The name of payload type. Will be taken `payload` constructor name    |
| **_command.corelationId_** | _string_  |    _optional_     | Id that used to join response to the command. By default random uuid. |
|  **_command.createdAt_**   |  _Date_   |    _optional_     | The date when command instans was created. By default curent time.    |

### Event

`abstract class` which one should extend your event class.

```ts
export class Test<T> extend Event<T> {
  // ...
}
```

The `Event` can be executed in a way that is more approach you or convenient from the client's perspective.

```ts
await new Event<T>(/*parameters*/).execute(dispatcher);
await dispatcher.execute(new Event<T>(/*parameters*/));
```

|     **_event.type_**     | _string_ |    _optional_     | The name of payload type. Will be taken `payload` constructor name    |
| **_event.corelationId_** | _string_ |    _optional_     | Id that used to join response to the command. By default random uuid. |
|  **_event.createdAt_**   |  _Date_  |    _optional_     | The date when command instans was created. By default curent time.    |
