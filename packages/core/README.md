# @secbox/core

The core package can be used to obtain a config including credentials from different sources, and provide a simplified abstraction to handle events and commands.

## Setup

```bash
npm i -s @secbox/core
```

## Usage

### Configuration

First, you need to generate a new instance of `Configuration`.

```ts
import { Configuration } from '@secbox/core';

const config = new Configuration({
  cluster: 'app.neuralegion.com',
  credentials: {
    token: 'xxxxxxx.xxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  }
});
```

After that, you can resolve the configuration using the IoC container.

```ts
const config = config.container.resolve(Configuration);
```

#### Options
```ts
interface ConfigurationOptions {
  cluster: string;
  credentials?: Credentials;
  credentialProviders?: CredentialProvider[];
}
```


#### cluster
- type `string`

Set url that used to access the application.

```ts
new Configuration({
  cluster: 'app.neuralegion.com',
})
```

#### credentials
- type `Credentials`

Set credentials to access the application.

```ts
new Configuration({
  credentials: {
    token: 'your API key'
  }
})
```

#### credentialProviders
- array of `CredentialProvider`

Allows you to provide credentials and load it in runtime. You can pass many providers, and credentials will be loaded from the first provider which successfully provides credentials. By default is present `EnvCredentialProvider`.

#### EnvCredentialProvider
Use this provider to read credentials from the following environment variable: BRIGHT_TOKEN

If the BRIGHT_TOKEN environment variable is not set or contains a falsy value, it will return undefined.

```ts
import { Configuration, EnvCredentialProvider } from '@secbox/core';

const credentialsProvider = new EnvCredentialProvider();
const config = new Configuration({
  credentialProviders: [credentialsProvider]
});
